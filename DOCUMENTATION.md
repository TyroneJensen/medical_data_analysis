# Detailed Documentation for Medical Data Science Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the NHANES dataset to derive health insights. The project involves data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source**: CDC's NHANES
- **Format**: XPT and CSV
- **Content**: Demographic and body measurement data

## Project Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone the project repository.
2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Use Python 3.11
   - Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Scripts and Their Functions
- **`data_download.py`**: Downloads datasets from the CDC website. Handles SSL verification issues by disabling SSL.
- **`data_processing.py`**: Cleans and processes the data. Creates an SQLite database and joins tables.
- **`analysis.py`**: Performs data analysis, including generating visualizations like age distribution and BMI vs. age.
- **`dashboard.py`**: Launches a Dash app for interactive visualization of the data.
- **`airflow_dag.py`**: Coordinates the execution of project scripts using Apache Airflow, running tasks at a set interval to automate data download, processing, analysis, and dashboard visualization.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. **Download Data**: Run `data_download.py` to fetch datasets.
2. **Process Data**: Execute `data_processing.py` to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Analyze Data**: Use `analysis.py` to perform analysis and generate visualizations.
4. **View Dashboard**: Start the dashboard using `dashboard.py` and access it via `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.
5. **Automate with Airflow**: Add `airflow_dag.py` to your Airflow DAGs directory and start the Airflow scheduler to automate the workflow.

## Automation with Apache Airflow
- **`airflow_dag.py`**: Coordinates the execution of project scripts using Apache Airflow, running tasks at a set interval to automate data download, processing, analysis, and dashboard visualization.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **SSL Issues**: Disabled SSL verification for dataset download.
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing data by filling with placeholders and ensuring correct data types.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Enhance dashboard with more interactive features.
- Improve data processing with more sophisticated techniques.

## Security Considerations
- Re-enable SSL verification for secure data handling.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing medical data using Python. It offers insights into health trends and serves as a foundation for further exploration and enhancement.
